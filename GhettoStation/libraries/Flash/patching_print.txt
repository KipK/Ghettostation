To use the F("...") inline "flash string" notation with Print::print() and 
Print::println(), a small patch needs to be added to the core Print.h file.  

This patch effectively tells the Print class that the Flash library objects
all support a print method, and that calling, for example

  Serial.print(obj);

is simply an alias for calling 

  obj.print(Serial);

To insert the patch, first insert this code near the top of Print.h, just
before the declaration of class Print:

  #define ARDUINO_CORE_PRINTABLE_SUPPORT
  class Print;
  class _Printable
  {
  public:
    virtual void print(Print &stream) const = 0;
  };

Then, inside the body of the Print class, add these lines, defining two
new methods:

  void print(const _Printable &obj) { obj.print(*this); }
  void println(const _Printable &obj) { obj.print(*this); println(); }

That's it!

If you have correctly patched the file, the flash_inline_strings.pde 
example should compile and work correctly.
